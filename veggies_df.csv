Potatoesrequire well-drained soil. (They will rot under prolonged cold, wetconditions.) If your soil is poorly drained or a heavy clay, considerusing raised beds. Adding organic matter (compost, cover crops,well-rotted manure or leaves) is a good way to improve soil beforegrowing potatoes. Go easy on organic matter sources high in nitrogen(such as manure) and nitrogen fertilizer as too much nitrogen canencourage lush foliage at the expense of tuber production.Unlikemost vegetables, potatoes perform best in acid soil with pH 4.8 - 5.5.Use scab-resistant varieties with pH above 6.0. Because most othergarden vegetables perform best at near-neutral pH, it’s usually notfeasible to grow potatoes in their preferred pH range, unless youdedicate one section of your garden to growing just potatoes inrotation with cover crops.Buy certified disease-free seedpotatoes from garden centers or through online or mail-order catalogsfor best results. If you save your own seed potatoes, discard any thatshow any signs of disease. Avoid planting potatoes from the supermarketbecause they may have been treated with sprout inhibitors. They mayalso be less vigorous and more prone to disease. Cut seedpotatoes that are larger than a chicken egg into pieces about 1 inchacross or slightly larger. Each piece should have at least one “eye”(the bud where the stem will grow from) -- preferably two eyes.Egg-sized and smaller tubers can be planted whole. Traditionally,cut seed potato pieces are allowed to cure for a few days to a fewweeks before planting. This is because the cut potatoes need highhumidity, plenty of oxygen and temperatures between 50 F and 65 F toheal quickly. If you have excellent, well-drained soil that meets thoseconditions, you can plant the seed pieces without curing. But ifconditions are not right, the seed potatoes will rot in the ground.Aless risky practice is to put about 5 pounds of cut potatoes into alarge grocery bag and fold the top closed. Keep the bag at roomtemperature for 2 or 3 days, then shake the bag to unstick pieces thatmay have stuck together. Let sit for another 2 to 3 days and then plant.Ifyou want fast emergence, keep the bag of cut potatoes at roomtemperature until sprouts appear. Some varieties are slow to breakdormancy and benefit from a 2- to 4-week “pre-warming” before planting.Others sprout in just a few days.Plant about 2 to 4 weeks beforeyour last frost date. The soil temperature should be at least 40 F. Donot plant where you've grown potatoes, tomatoes, peppers or eggplant inthe past 2 years.One common way to plant potatoes is to dig ashallow trench about 4 inches deep with a hoe. Place the seed potatopieces with their eyes up (cut sides down) about 8 to 12 inches apartin the trench, and replace soil. Space trenches about 2 to 3 feetapart. Stems and foliage should emerge in about 2 to 4 weeks, dependingon soil temperature.When the plants are about 6 to 8 inchestall, “hill” the potatoes by hoeing soil loosely around the base of theplants to within about an inch of the lower leaves from both sides ofthe row. Repeat in about 2 to 3 weeks. You may want to make additionalhillings, gradually building a 6- to 8-inch ridge down the row.(Hilling keeps the developing potatoes from being exposed to sun, whichturns them green and bitter. Green potatoes contain a chemical,solanine, which is toxic in large amounts.)Alternatively,snuggle seed pieces shallowly into the soil and cover with a thicklayer of clean straw or other weed-free mulch. Add more mulch as neededto keep light from reaching potatoes. (A foot or more of mulch may berequired.) Tubers grown this way can be easily harvested by pullingback the mulch after the plants die.A third method if you haveexcellent potato-growing soil is to plant seed potatoes 7 to 8 inchesdeep and skip hilling or deep mulching. The potatoes are slower toemerge, but this method requires less effort during the growing season.Deep planting is not good in cold, damp soils and it requires more workto dig the potatoes at harvest.Potatoes need at least 1 inch ofwater per week from either rainfall or deep watering. Mulching helpsretain moisture. Keeping the soil from drying out also helps reducescab.Use row covers to protect from Colorado potato beetles,leaf hoppers and flea beetles.

Transplants that are too mature often stall aftertransplanting while younger, smaller plants pass them by, producingearlier and more fruit.Startingyour own plants from seed gives you more choices of which variety togrow. But if you start your own plants, be sure you have a place wherethey can get enough light. Even a sunny, south-facing window is barelyadequate. Consider using a grow light to supplement sunlight. Don’tstart plants too early. Sow seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks beforetransplanting outside. Plant them 1/8 inch deep in sterile seedstarting mix in flats or cells. Seeds germinate best at 75 F to 90 F.Then grow transplants at about 70 F.Don’t rush to transplant,either. Cold soil and air temperatures can stress plants. Wait at leasta week or two after the last frost. Nighttime temperatures should beconsistently above 45 F. Use black plastic mulch to warm soil and/orrow covers, hot caps or other protection to keep plants warm early inthe season. Remove covers whenever temperatures exceed 85 F.Hardenoff plants before transplanting by reducing water and fertilizer, notby exposing to cold temperatures, which can stress them and stuntgrowth. Transplants exposed to cold temperatures (60 F to 65 F day and50 F to 60 F night) are more prone to catfacing.Space transplants:12 to 24 inches apart for determinate varieties14 to 20 inches apart for staked indeterminate varieties24 to 36 inches apart for unstaked indeterminate varietiesUnlikemost plants, tomatoes do better if planted deeper than they were grownin containers. Set them in the ground so that the soil level is justbelow the lowest leaves. Roots will form along the buried stem,establishing a stronger root system.To reduce root disease risk,don't plant on soils that have recently grown tomatoes, potatoes,peppers or eggplant for at least two years. Mulch plants afterthe soil has warmed up to maintain soil moisture and suppress weeds.Tomatoes need a consistent supply of moisture. If it rains less than 1inch per week, water to make up the difference.Many factors (inaddition to your choice of variety) affect total yield, first harvestand fruit quality. Raised beds, black plastic mulch and providingconsistent moisture by watering or through drip irrigation are goodways to improve all three.How you provide support to plants canalso affect performance. Determinate varieties do not need staking. Butstaking and pruning indeterminate varieties can hasten first harvest bya week or more, improve fruit quality, keep fruit cleaner, and makeharvest easier. Staking and pruning usually reduces total yield, butfruits will tend to be larger. Staked and pruned plants are also moresusceptible to blossom end rot and sunscald. Allowing indeterminatevarieties to sprawl reduces labor, but takes up more space and plantsare more prone to disease.Wooden tomato stakes are typicallyabout 6 feet long and 1 ½ inch square, but you can use similarmaterials. Drive stakes at least 8 to 10 inches deep at or soon aftertransplanting so as not to damage roots.Prune tomatoes to one ortwo vigorous stems by snapping off “suckers” (stems growing from whereleaf stems meet the main stem) when they are 2 to 4 inches long. Tiestems to stake with soft string, twine or cloth, forming a figure-8with the stem in one loop and the stake in the other. This gives thestem room to expand without being constricted. Start about 8 to 12inches above the ground and continue to tie at similar intervals as theplant grows. As an alternative to using individual stakes, grow severalplants in a row between heavy-duty stakes or posts spaced about 4 feetapart, and use twine to weave in and out around posts and plants.Growingtomatoes in cages is a good compromise between labor-intensive stakingand just letting them sprawl. You can purchase tomato cages at yourlocal garden center, or simply bend a 6-foot-long piece of 4- to 6-inchwire mesh into a cylinder about 22 inches in diameter. (Cattle fencingor concrete reinforcing wire mesh work well for this.) Place cagearound plants soon after transplanting and anchor with stakes.Avoidexcessive N applications, which can cause excessive foliage and poorfruit set. Also avoid using fresh manure or high nitrogen fertilizers(those with three or more times nitrogen than phosphorus or potassium).Poor fruit set can also be caused by heavy rainfall or temperaturesthat are either too high (above 90 F) or too low (below 55 F). Onmost soils, you can sidedress about 1/2 cup of 5-10-5 per plant andwork shallowly into the top inch of soil when fruits are about 1 inchin diameter and again when harvest begins.To avoid other common tomato problems:Keepsoil evenly moist to prevent blossom end rot. This can also helpprevent cracking when fruit absorbs water too fast after heavy rainfollowing dry conditions. Do not remove leaves that shade fruit to prevent sunscald.  Catfacing(misshapen, deformed fruit) is caused by incomplete pollination,usually due to cold weather.
