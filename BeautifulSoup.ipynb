Cold treatmentof starts (keeping temperature between 35 F and 50 F for about 10 days)can induce flowering in first-year plants. Transplant outside aftersoil has reached 60 F.Benefits from the use of a low-nitrogenfertilizer (high in phosphorus and potassium), which can beincorporated before planting. Plants usually don’t flower the first year.Toincrease chance of overwintering, head back to 12 inches and cover withleaves, covered with baskets or boxes, and heap more leaves over thetop of the basket. Another alternative is to dig roots and store in acold (but not freezing) room. Pot up about a month before transplantingout after last frost.While individual plants may live up to 15 years or more, divide about every 3 years to keep planting productive.\n"
